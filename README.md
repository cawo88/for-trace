# Liebe soll dich begleiten

_Liebe soll dich begleiten_ is a collaborative project by five artists to honour the life of a dear friend named Paul. Paul loved music and always worn headphones. The audiovisual aims to heal grief—Paul's physical death is not the end of individual existence, but the beginning; his soul ascends and continues in the world.
